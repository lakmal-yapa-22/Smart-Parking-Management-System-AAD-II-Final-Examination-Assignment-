# Smart Parking Management System (SPMS)

## Overview
Smart Parking Management System (SPMS) is a cloud-native, microservice-based platform designed to solve real-world parking issues in urban environments. It enables users to search, reserve, and pay for parking spaces in real-time while allowing space owners to manage availability efficiently.

### Features
- Real-time space availability and reservation
- User and vehicle registration
- Simulated vehicle entry and exit
- Internal payment system with digital receipts
- Centralized configuration and dynamic service discovery

## Microservices Architecture

| Microservice               | Port  | Responsibilities                                          |
|---------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| API Gateway               | 8080  | Routes client requests to respective services             |
| Config Server             | 8888  | Centralized configuration management                      |
| Eureka Server             | 8761  | Service registry and discovery                            |
| Parking Space Service     | 8083  | Manage parking spots and availability                     |
| Payment Service           | 8084  | Simulate payments and generate receipts                   |
| User Service              | 8081  | User registration and profile management                  |
| Vehicle Service           | 8082  | Register and manage vehicles                              |

## How to Run

1. **Start Eureka Server (`8761`)**
2. **Start Config Server (`8888`)**
3. **Start all microservices (User, Vehicle, Parking, Payment)**
4. **Start API Gateway (`8080`)**
5. Use Postman collection to test the endpoints.
